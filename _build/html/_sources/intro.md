# Software Engineering for Researchers

## Introduction

This book is for someone like me circa 2015, immediately after I graduated from my Ph.D. You find yourself doing data-science research entirely based in code. Your programming is mostly self-taught, maybe except for a few introductory lectures in your stats classes. Despite that, you've built some cool things! Maybe it's an interactive dashboard, maybe a dissertation based on simulations, maybe even a new statistical method.

If you are like 2015 Me, your projects generally live in a single file, a thousand lines long. In order to rerun an analysis, to change a model specification or update it to a new data release, you need to run each line one-by-one, making sure you didn't hardcode an assumption that no longer holds. Implementing that update means ten different changes to ten different lines, and you might (will?) miss one.

But also, you find yourself enjoying coding. You enjoy thinking about how to implement your system. The elegance of a clean solution to a problem gives you a shot of dopamine. And you're ready for the next step.

You're ready to think about **Software *Engineering***. Not just coding or programming, engineering is the act of thinking about the structure of your code, how it's designed in order to be reliable, extensible, and understandable to readers. Its lessons are what allows our entire modern world to depend on lines of code written by fallible humans.

This book is designed to introduce you to software engineering topics that will give you the most bang for your buck. I'll introduce you to patterns that, with practice, will mean you write clean, extensible, error-free code on your first try. I've tried to purge from this book topics that you don't really need to know, or that can wait for the day you actually do make the career change to software engineer. And most importantly, I'll point you to further reading, and present just the right amount of jargon so you know what to google when you want more.
